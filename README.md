# Maze-Test
This is just a small Maze Game made in Java with a seed system, a bad seed system, and a (relatively dumb) AI
* Main is the main runner class for the program
* Create creates a 2d Char Array
* Seed adds m and P
* Game is the class containing the code for the main game it returns the number of moves you took
* AI is the class containing the dumb ai
* Auto is a file used to find bad seeds
* Find is a helper class meant to help find m and P
* Print is another helper class meant to print the char array
* Turn is the last of the helper methods that just implement going up, down, right, or left
